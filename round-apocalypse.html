          <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
							<p>Round Apocalypse is a top down scrolling shooter game created using Android Studio. The player travels in space in search for a habital
								planet while being hunted by their predators. The game utilizes the device's sensors for interactive gameplay
								keeps high scores using a SQLite database. I created the interface for Round Apocalypse and coded the functionality of the program.</p>

      <h1>DESIGN AND PROCESS</h1>

        <h2>Initial Idea</h2>
        <p>We created a game for this mobile application that utilizes a phone's hardware
          and software systems. We then decided to go with a top down scrolling shooter game,
        where a player is travelling through a map and destroying enemies along the way.
        The goal of this project is to develop a game with entertainment value that can help
        improve a player's reflexes and hand eye coordination. </p>

        <h2>First Prototype</h2>
					<p>This game interface wireframe is used during development of the project. By using minimalistic objects I can visually focus on parts of the game that I am working on.
					Making sure the functionality of the code is working and debugged properly allows for less complications if I run into an error later. </p>

          </figure>

          <div>
  					<p>Left: Introduction screen used to launch the game.</p>
  					<p>Middle: Basic game system with a playable character (green), and enemies (red) that shoot projectiles.</p>
  					<p>Right: Power ups are being integrated.
  				</div>

        <h2>AN INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE</h2>
						<p>We felt that interactivity is important to create an enjoyable gaming experience. I integrated the use of the phone's sensors for the commands of the player's character.
						For example, tilting the phone to the left and right side moves the player to the corresponding location. Tapping the phone unleashes a powerful attack and shaking the phone
						grants the player protection with a shield. The purpose of this is to allow players to perform different actions while playing, thus making a dynamic gameplay experience.  </p>

  						<div class = "width-30">

  						</div>
  					</div>


				<h2>VISUAL OVERHAUL</h2>
  				  <p>After the program can run functionally, we designed characters and icons
            for the game's aesthetics. The app features heart icon for lives, wide-shot
            attack and shield power ups, and as well as an infinite scrolling background.</p>

  					</figure>

  					<div class = "caption-container">
  						<p class="caption">Left: Location of the icons used in the game and what they represent.</p>
  						<p class="caption">Right: Indicator to show where the user is visually focused on during gameplay.</p>
  					</div>

				<h2>MAKING DESIGN CHOICES</h2>
  					<p>One of the major choices I made in designing the UI was where to put the icons for lives, power ups, and the score. I decided that lives and power ups were more important than the score,
  					and chose the corners of the screen to place the information because it is visually easy to locate. The icons for lives and power ups are in the bottom left and right corners, respectively.
  					This is because the player character remains on near the bottom of the screen, and the user can quickly glance side to side to visualize the UI and determine how many lives or power ups
  					they have remaining.</p>
