    				<h2>Overview</h2>
      				<p>Conextus is a social networking startup company. In a team
              of two, I designed and coded layouts for the company website. The purpose is to
              create a platform that provides information about the company through web communications.
              The process of designing this project required research, meetings with clients,
      	      and documentation. The website is coded with HTML and CSS.  </p>

        <h2>Design and Process</h2>

            <p>The company provided us with some information about what they want on the
              website and a rough mockup. When I started working I met with the executive
              team to discuss the design of the mockup and how it can be improved. </p>

          <figure>
            <img src="img/Conextus/initial_index_screenshot1-01.jpg" alt=""   class="border-none img-responsive"/>
            <img src="img/Conextus/initial_index_screenshot2-01.jpg" alt=""  class="border-none img-responsive"/>
          </figure>

    				<p>After looking at the layout, I saw a lack of hierarchy and I did not like
              how the elements on the page were laid out. The content could have been
              separated into sections rather than having large boxes of text.
      				This makes it easier for the user to read and follow along. The website
              also lacked a definitive colour scheme that represented the branding of the company.</p>

  				<h2>Wants Vs Needs</h2>
  					<p> First, we had to lay out what is the purpose of the website? Who are its target audience? What type of design approach does Conextus want?
  					The layout desired by Conextus is a scrolling website that provides company information and content about what services they provide.
  					In other words, it's a layout where the user can continuously read and watch content by scrolling without having to navigate through multiple web pages. </p>

  				<h2>Design Considerations</h2>
  					<p>I designed this new layout so that each section is more distinguished from one another. The content has been separated into different components, information about the company and their
  					application. I suggested to accompany each section with relevant graphics to help users understand the content better. </p>

    			<h1>Reflections</h1>
  						<p>Working with projects in university meant that we could create our own personas
                and design values. However, designing for a company meant there are tougher constraints.
  						This was a great experience for me because I learned how to compromise and use these constraints to push my design to the another level. For example, our team did not have a media producer.
  						The lack of media content meant we had limited resources to use in our design that truly reflected the company's values, whereas for a school project we could search online for free media.
  						So instead I created more graphics to use instead, such as application layouts and icons. I've acquired valuable experience from Conextus through working in a real world situation and
  						I hope to continue learning from different companies where I can expand my web development skill set.</p>
